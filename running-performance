# Running Performance Prediction (Master’s Thesis)

This project analyzes running activity data and applies machine learning to predict running performance metrics.

## Goal
- Analyze running activity data
- Build and optimize ML models for performance prediction
- Interpret results using feature importance and residual analysis

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Workflow
1. Data collection via Strava API
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training (Gradient Boosting)
5. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
6. Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)

## Results
- Best model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Optimized using GridSearchCV
- Key drivers include distance, elevation, cadence, and heart rate features

## Notes on Data
Raw data is not publicly shared due to privacy.  
The notebooks contain the full methodology and can be reproduced using personal Strava data.
